# Single objective designs for toxicology

This is a self-contained R Shiny app for designing dose-response experiments in
toxicology. The app allows the user the find optimal designs for several dose-response
models and to compare the efficiency of two designs. Metaheuristics are used to find
the designs, which makes it easy to extend the app the find designs for new models.
